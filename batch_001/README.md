| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2F Time     | 2 Days                                                                                         |
| Bottle1     | ~40% Blood orange juce too carbonated; tastes good, maybe a bit too sweet                      |
| Bottle2     | ~30% Blood orange juice sat in fridge for longer; carbonation was much more chilled very sweet |
| Bottle3     | No Juice, no sugar; no carbonation... a total fail.                                            |

For next time:

- Always filter the juice!
- More 1F time to cut the sugar
- Clean the rims of the bottles before capping them; otherwise they'll be hard to open later.
